            <h2>Curious about me? Here you have it:</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack <br>
                development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the <br>
                technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel <br>
                perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me <br>
                <br>
                I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued <br>
                to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the <br>
                latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after <br>
                starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web <br>
                applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, <br>
                Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more. <br>
                <br>
                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to <br>
                end, from ideation all the way to development. <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on <br>
                twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying <br>
                some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where I share tech-related bites <br>
                and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub. <br>
                <br>
                Finally, some quick bits about me. <br>
